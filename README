  to create a board using the Board variable type and specifiying the size as the initialization input
  A main game loop which does the following:
    collect input and calls the placeStone() function, supplying it with the input
    a checkCap() function call to check if any stones need to be captured
    and a changePlayer() function to rotate the player pool
